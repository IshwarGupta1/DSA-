CAP Theorem
C = all nodes will have same values after any action
A = all nodes will return non error response
P = network failure still system works

CP - example bank when we do transaction, at all places we will get same amount reflected.

AP - like amazon big billion day sale, for every order it must be added in cart

CA - not possible practically as n/w failures cannot be avoided

consistency - eventual & strong
eventual means not strict or immediate but eventually all nodes will be consistent
strong is strict

	we will use no sql db to store user preference
	sql db for messages in scheduler db
	blob storage for large emails
	for validation check we can use RBAC
	We need to add rate limiting too
	
	to scale up we can
	add more instances of notification service
	db partitioning based on user id
	no sql db partitioning based on time
	redis caching for no sql db faster access
	using distributed message queues like kafka

User-Session (1-n): One User can organize multiple Sessions.
Session-Task (1-n): One Session can have multiple Tasks.
User-Task (n-n): Many Users can vote on many Tasks, with the vote (or selected card) stored as a value in the join table (UserTaskVote).

Instead of explicitly modeling the "Card" entity, you can treat the card selection as a "vote" stored in a join table between User and Task.
The join table (UserTaskVote) would contain the UserID, TaskID, and the selected CardValue (representing the vote).
This ensures that each user can only vote once per task.

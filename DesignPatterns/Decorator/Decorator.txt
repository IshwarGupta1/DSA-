A Decorator Pattern says that just "attach a flexible additional responsibilities to an object dynamically".

In other words, The Decorator Pattern uses composition instead of inheritance to extend the functionality of an object at runtime.

The Decorator Pattern is also known as Wrapper.



First Create interface
then concrete for interface
then abstract decorator implementing interface
then child of the abstract 

in main
call the concrete first
then call decorator with concrete inside it
then call decorator methods

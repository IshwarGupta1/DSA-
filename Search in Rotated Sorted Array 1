There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
Place the 2 pointers i.e. low and high: Initially, we will place the pointers like this: low will point to the first index, and high will point to the last index.
Calculate the ‘mid’: Now, inside a loop, we will calculate the value of ‘mid’ using the following formula:
mid = (low+high) // 2 ( ‘//’ refers to integer division)
Check if arr[mid] == target: If it is, return the index mid.
Identify the sorted half, check where the target is located, and then eliminate one half accordingly:
If arr[low] <= arr[mid]: This condition ensures that the left part is sorted.
If arr[low] <= target && target <= arr[mid]: It signifies that the target is in this sorted half. So, we will eliminate the right half (high = mid-1).
Otherwise, the target does not exist in the sorted half. So, we will eliminate this left half by doing low = mid+1.
Otherwise, if the right half is sorted:
If arr[mid] <= target && target <= arr[high]: It signifies that the target is in this sorted right half. So, we will eliminate the left half (low = mid+1).
Otherwise, the target does not exist in this sorted half. So, we will eliminate this right half by doing high = mid-1.
Once, the ‘mid’ points to the target, the index will be returned.
This process will be inside a loop and the loop will continue until low crosses high. If no index is found, we will return -1.
 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1
